This repository contains Chainer and MATLAB code for multiplicative LSTM that was used for some results from the paper. The training configuration for initial experiments run on Hutter Prize is given in the matlab folder. Code for the most successful mLSTM configuration we have found to date is given in the chainer folder. The Chainer code was used to achieve 1.24 bits/char on Hutter Prize and 1.27 bits/char on text8. Each folder has its own separate instructions.
